# 🖼️ Image Encryption & Decryption using AES (Frontend)

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to securely encrypt and decrypt image files using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm entirely on the frontend. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no backend or server-side processing involved.

## 🔐 Features

- 📤 Encrypt image files directly in the browser using AES
- 🔐 Decrypt previously encrypted images
- 🔁 All operations are client-side — your data never leaves your device
- 🧠 Simple and intuitive user interface

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the web application
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Logic for encryption/decryption
- **CryptoJS** – Library for AES encryption
